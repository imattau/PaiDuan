## üõ†Ô∏è Sprint ‚ì≥ ‚Äì Nostr Auth, Onboarding & Profile Management

### Objective

Replace ‚ÄúEnter Feed‚Äù with standard Nostr login flow, support new/imported keys, remote signer logins, onboarding after auth, and complete profile management.

### Tasks

| #   | Area                 | Work required                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Replace entry        | Remove ‚ÄúEnter Feed‚Äù button. Add Nostr login UI on landing page with 3 options: **Import key**, **Generate new key**, **Remote signer login** (NIP-46/NIP-07). |
| 2   | Key import           | Support `nsec` and raw hex; decode to 32-byte Uint8Array; validate length; save to localStorage/session.                                                      |
| 3   | Key generation       | Use `nostr-tools` `generateSecretKey()` (not deprecated `generatePrivateKey()`), derive pubkey; store keys.                                                   |
| 4   | Remote signer        | Implement NIP-46 connect flow; persist pubkey, no privkey stored.                                                                                             |
| 5   | Post-auth onboarding | After successful import/generate/login, route to `/onboarding/profile`.                                                                                       |
| 6   | Enable notifications | Prompt user to grant browser notification permission and register push subscription.                                                                          |
| 7   | Profile onboarding   | If imported key has existing kind 0 profile, prefill name, picture, about; else show empty form.                                                              |
| 8   | Profile UI           | Avatar upload (browser file ‚Üí Blob URL or upload to media API), name, bio; publish kind 0 metadata to relays.                                                 |
| 9   | Profile page         | `/p/[pubkey]` shows banner, avatar, name, bio, zaps, follow; edit button if own profile.                                                                      |
| 10  | Export keys          | Settings ‚Üí ‚ÄúKeys‚Äù section to copy/export `nsec` or pubkey; warn about privkey handling.                                                                       |
| 11  | Testing              | Validate that login state persists, keys work for publishing/zaps, and onboarding flows correctly.                                                            |

### Acceptance Criteria

- Landing page shows modern styled login buttons (dark/light mode visible).
- Import accepts both `nsec` and hex, rejects invalid keys.
- Generate uses new API and stores keys locally.
- Remote signer works with NIP-46/NIP-07 providers.
- Onboarding after auth leads to profile setup or edit.
- Profile updates publish to relays and reflect in `/p/[pubkey]`.
- Keys can be exported from settings.
- All UI responsive for desktop, tablet, mobile.

## üõ†Ô∏è Sprint ‚ì¥ ‚Äì Creator Tools UX Overhaul & Video Processing Fixes

### Objective

Modernise Creator Wizard UI, fix tool loading/trim bugs, and ensure WebM (9:16) is default format. Recording in the browser is currently out of scope.

### Tasks

| #   | Area               | Work required                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12  | CreatorWizard UI   | Replace current 3-step flow with wizard that first asks ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù ‚Äî options: **Upload existing** or **Import from URL**.                                                                      |
| 13  | Dynamic components | Load relevant step component depending on option (e.g., `UploadStep.tsx`).                                                                                                                                    |
| 14  | Upload             | Existing file input flow; enforce ‚â§3 minutes; immediately transcode if not WebM.                                                                                                                              |
| 15  | Transcoding        | Use the WebCodecs API with a polyfill; default to WebM VP9, 9:16 crop.                                                                                                                                        |
| 16  | Trim tool          | Ensure trim UI loads only after video metadata loaded; fix ‚Äúpressing Next throws trim error‚Äù by validating clip bounds.                                                                                       |
| 17  | Poster capture     | Frame capture via `<canvas>`; store as JPEG/WebP; attach to upload payload.                                                                                                                                   |
| 18  | Upload flow        | POST video + poster to `nostr.media/api/upload`; show progress; capture `video`, `poster` & `manifest` URLs and publish kind‚Äë30023 event with `v`, `image`, `vman`, optional `zap` and one `t` tag per topic. |
| 19  | Error handling     | Toasts for FFmpeg load failure, file type issues, upload errors.                                                                                                                                              |
| 20  | Responsive design  | Wizard lets steps manage their own widths; metadata step displays preview and fields side-by-side on large (`lg`) screens.                                                                                    |
| 21  | Event publishing   | CreatorWizard publishes a signed kind-30023 event containing video URL, poster, manifest, zap address, and topic tags.                                                                                        |

### Acceptance Criteria

- CreatorWizard first screen is option chooser.
- Uploading and importing work end-to-end; no in-browser recording is provided.
- All videos output as WebM (VP9), 9:16 cropped if needed.
- Trim works without errors; poster capture succeeds.
- UI looks modern, consistent with landing/auth redesign.
- FFmpeg loads only when needed, no `createFFmpeg` import errors.
- Metadata screen shows video preview (left) and metadata form (right) in two columns on large screens.

## Progressive Web App UI Standard

- Installable on desktop and mobile via the browser menu or the in-app install banner.
- Works offline by caching pages, avatars and the last 20 videos watched.
- Zap / comment buttons disable while offline.
- Clear cached videos via **Settings ‚Üí Storage**.

## Feed session queue & resume

- The feed agent maintains a session-scoped queue and persists `lastIndex`, `lastCursor` and `lastCursorTime` so users return to the same position after a refresh.
- Items older than seven days are pruned and `since` timestamps in subsequent requests keep the feed fresh.
- Resuming relies on the stored cursor's timestamp; if the referenced video has been pruned or is older than a week, the feed falls back to the top.

### Developer testing

- Toggle `enableFeedResume` in Settings.
- Scroll a few videos, refresh the page and confirm the same item is selected.
- Clear `localStorage` or disable the flag to reset; stale cursors beyond a week will not restore.

## UI/UX Improvement Tasks for Codex

- **Typography:** Adopt a consistent font stack with clearly defined heading, body, and caption sizes.
- **Colour & Accessibility:** Ensure colours meet WCAG AA contrast; provide light and dark palettes.
- **Layout & Spacing:** Follow an 8px spacing scale and maintain responsive grid layouts.
- **Component Styling:** Buttons, inputs and cards share consistent radius, shadows and hover/active states.
- **Comments:** Comments display avatar, name, timestamp, and support nested replies with clear indentation.
- **Profile Area:** Profile pages show banner, avatar, bio and stats, with edit controls for the owner.
